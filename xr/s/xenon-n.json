Commonly known as N, this vessel cant be held up against most other fighters with its average agility and below average weapon systems. The Xenon, however, are quite capable and willing to throw hundreds or thousands of Ns into a battle, if necessary. Just as with the other ships employed by the machines, it is not known where its production facilities are located; this is a secret all non-machine factions would like to see exposed. \n", "production": {"food rations": 25, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 2, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 2, "reinforced metal plating": 6, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 73, "microchips": 1}, "name": "Xenon N", "definition": "Sector patrol"}
