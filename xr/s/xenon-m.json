Although the intentions of the machines are generally unknowable, the Ms sub-par engine and, for a fighter, weak weapon systems seem to suggest that this fighter is not meant to be thrown into full battle. There were, however, at least two separate incidents in which the Xenon sent large numbers of this craft into combat, probably because other options were unavailable to them at the time. Operating in large numbers, the M was able to turn the table in favour of the machines on both events despite its shortcomings. \n", "production": {"food rations": 29, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 2, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 2, "reinforced metal plating": 7, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 85, "microchips": 2}, "name": "Xenon M", "definition": "Fighter"}
