Instead it is manufactured by Theonray Defence Systems as that firms only completely space-ready defence system product. Its armament is relatively weak but it is outfitted with a solid single-block Eterscel engine that has been praised as being an indestructible workhorse. This innovative engine is of a very unique design indeed; it can be lifted from one craft and mated with another (even of a different type) within less than two hours. Originally intended as a reconnaissance craft with limited tactical capabilities, the Eterscel Raider is nowadays mainly used a sector patrol craft. \n", "production": {"food rations": 22, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 2, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 1, "reinforced metal plating": 3, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 64, "microchips": 1}, "name": "Eterscel Raider", "definition": "Sector patrol"}
