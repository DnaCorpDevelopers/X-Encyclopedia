Since it is carrying an array of guided missiles, its acceleration parameters are not as good as one might expect. However, its low-latency attitude thrusters easily counter this flaw by offering great manoeuvrability. The Maelchon is almost exclusively used on patrol missions.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 36, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 2, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 1, "reinforced metal plating": 4, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 104, "microchips": 2}, "name": "Maelchon", "definition": "Sector patrol"}
