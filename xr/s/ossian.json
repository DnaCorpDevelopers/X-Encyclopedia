The tactical capabilities of the Ossian are severely limited by its for all intents and purposes nonexistent offensive weaponry. This fighter is sometimes called the tin can or, more poignantly, the death trap; the latter refers to the fact that during the last half decade more pilots have died in this ship alone than in all other similarly sized crafts of all factions put together. Most of those deaths occurred outside of combat.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 13, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 1, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 1, "reinforced metal plating": 2, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 39, "microchips": 1}, "name": "Ossian", "definition": "Escort"}
