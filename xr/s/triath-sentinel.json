While certainly within the limits of what one could expect, the Triath Sentinel exceeds the design of any and all PMC ships so far with the exception, naturally, of the Golem and the Moebius. While not the fastest ship of its class, its manoeuvrability is better than average, as is its weapons array. Used mostly as reinforcements during imminent border incidents or similar conflicts, this brand-new vessel has yet to see serious combat. Experts, however, do not doubt that it will perform exceedingly well.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 40, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 2, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 1, "reinforced metal plating": 5, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 115, "microchips": 2}, "name": "Triath Sentinel", "definition": "Fighter"}
