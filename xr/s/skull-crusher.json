Due to its superiority back when first introduced before the Fall Of The Gates, this ship, when maintained properly, can be held up to even some modern fighters. It has reasonably responsive main thrusters giving it good acceleration but is somewhat lacking in manoeuvrability. Its armament is average at best but here, just as with the Bonescout, Split determination makes up for material shortcomings. \n", "production": {"food rations": 33, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 2, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 1, "reinforced metal plating": 4, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 97, "microchips": 2}, "name": "Skull Crusher", "definition": "Fighter"}
