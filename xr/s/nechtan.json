A saying amongst BA pilots states that, although it looks like a fighter, the Nechtan can run, but it can never fight. This is only partially true, as was proven in the Split Blitz operation following the Split Downtime, where three Nechtans alone managed to incapacitate a Carrier (but were, unfortunately, destroyed shortly after this remarkable and unexpected victory).\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 27, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 2, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 1, "reinforced metal plating": 3, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 79, "microchips": 1}, "name": "Nechtan", "definition": "Fighter"}
