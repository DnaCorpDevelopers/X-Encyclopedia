Designed by Beryll Astrotech - the successor organisation of the then illegal Beryll hi-tech syndicate - the Artio builds on technology gleaned from Terraformer artefacts, like much of the machinery and ships manufactured by Beryll Astrotech. The Artio has only a token weapon which makes it basically unfit for combat. However, with its highly responsive main and attitude thrusters, this little craft is extremely well suited for covert operations near or between orbital installations.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 17, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 1, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 1, "reinforced metal plating": 2, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 50, "microchips": 1}, "name": "Artio", "definition": "Covert ops"}
