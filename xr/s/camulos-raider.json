As with all vessels manufactured by Jonferson Space Systems, this ship is based on two-way antimatter conversion technology (M-AM/AM-M). When Jonferson Space Dynamics Division (JSDD) disbanded right after the Fall of the Gates, several of the firms subsidiaries located in different sectors continued operations on their own. Jonferson Space Systems is the largest of them. Common to all subsidiaries was JSDDs head start in M-AM/AM-M conversion. Despite many efforts of competitors to reverse-engineer or just steal it, this innovation (called a tech miracle by some) has remained firmly with the JSDD subsidiaries.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 27, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 2, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 1, "reinforced metal plating": 3, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 80, "microchips": 1}, "name": "Camulos Raider", "definition": "Fighter"}
