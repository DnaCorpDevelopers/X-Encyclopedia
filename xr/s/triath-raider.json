As such, its clearly the kind of design one would expect from PMC. Experts have no doubt about this; it is quite unlike the Golem and Moebius which couldnt have been designed by PMC alone. The Triath Raider is mainly used for patrolling undisputed territory but also used for scout and reconnaissance missions.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 20, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 1, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 1, "reinforced metal plating": 2, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 57, "microchips": 1}, "name": "Triath Raider", "definition": "Sector patrol"}
