Unlike other PMC designed ships, the Triath Vanguard features a reasonably balanced acceleration, good weapon systems (including guided missiles), a robust design and a somewhat modern layout. With an appearance not unlike an upgraded Triath Raider, this ship is said by combat pilots who have flown it in and out of battle to fly like a charm and bring you home too. Rumour has it that PMC is working on heavier craft based on the Triath Vanguards design, the first of which being the Triath Sentinel for imminent release to active duty as at the time of writing.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 29, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 2, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 1, "reinforced metal plating": 3, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 84, "microchips": 2}, "name": "Triath Vanguard", "definition": "Fighter"}
