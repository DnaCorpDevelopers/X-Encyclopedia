Surprisingly, trading off acceleration and manoeuvrability for the mass of a large dumbfire missile arsenal does not take the edge off this infamous ship; the opposite is the case. With its additional potent energy weapon array, the Camulos Sentinel has proven an invaluable asset during many a battle. Its role in the Fourth Xenon Uprising (also known as IRQ4 conflict) cannot be overstated.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 58, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 3, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 1, "reinforced metal plating": 7, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 168, "microchips": 4}, "name": "Camulos Sentinel", "definition": "Fighter"}
