Its high manoeuvrability and powerful engines give it an edge over many other vessels of its class. When one or more Hesus are observed within a sector, it is immediately known that an important political event must be taking place shortly somewhere nearby. Because of this, the Hesus is commonly known as a harbinger of peace - or of war.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 30, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 2, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 1, "reinforced metal plating": 4, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 88, "microchips": 2}, "name": "Hesus", "definition": "Escort"}
