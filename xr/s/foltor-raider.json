While the Camulos Raider, like its cousins, is based on JSSs proprietary M-AM/AM-M conversion technology, the Foltor Raider achieves similar results by its exceedingly efficient use of more conventional technology.\nEquipped with only an average array of weapons, the Foltor Raiders heavy thrusters nevertheless generate enough thrust to compete with much smaller vessels. Owing to the fast response of its attitude jets, the Foltor Raider is surprisingly agile for a ship of its size.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 30, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 2, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 1, "reinforced metal plating": 4, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 88, "microchips": 2}, "name": "Foltor Raider", "definition": "Fighter"}
