Initially a small mining survey ship, the Hayabusa was retrofitted to a combat role to defend against the Reivers. The Hayabusa has good acceleration for a ship its size, while its manoeuvrability is only average. Its weapon systems are at best described as weak. Just like the Daito, the Hayabusa is a good choice for day-to-day patrolling duties but is only second-best when it comes to combat. \n", "production": {"food rations": 18, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 1, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 1, "reinforced metal plating": 3, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 52, "microchips": 1}, "name": "Hayabusa", "definition": "Fighter"}
