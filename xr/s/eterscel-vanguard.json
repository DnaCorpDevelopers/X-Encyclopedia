It is BTO (built to order) and can be outfitted with a selection from two different hulls, one or two Eterscel single-block engines, and a range of weapons. As ordered by Heart of Albion, the Eterscel Vanguard is quite similar to the Eterscel Raider trading off lower acceleration parameters against the larger mass of its improved armament and different hull. Pilots across sectors are full of praise for the Eterscel line of craft, particularly for its name-giving engines. It is very sought-after by privateers and achieves stellar prices on the used vehicle market.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 37, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 2, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 1, "reinforced metal plating": 4, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 108, "microchips": 2}, "name": "Eterscel Vanguard", "definition": "Fighter"}
