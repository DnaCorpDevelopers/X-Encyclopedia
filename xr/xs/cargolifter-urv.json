Autonomously controlled by a very basic AI, Cargolifter URVs are responsible for loading and unloading of ships and stations, or transferring goods between them. Usually equipped with strong reaction thrusters capable of short acceleration peaks, Cargolifter URVs show increased fuel consumption when transporting large masses quickly. This, naturally, is expected system behaviour and poses no operational challenge. \n", "production": {"food rations": 488, "bio-optic wiring": 194, "scanning array": 48, "plasma-flow regulators": 14, "fusion reactors": 7, "reinforced metal plating": 16, "podkletnov generators": 8, "energy cells": 716, "microchips": 34}, "name": "Cargolifter URV", "definition": "Cargo drone"}
