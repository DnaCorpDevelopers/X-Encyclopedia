They are mainly deployed at the building sites of large-scale space engineering projects like stations, inside of wharfs, and at orbital accelerator waypoints. Depending on the particular application, MECs are also used to carry out servicing and maintenance of stations and capital ships. Their wide range of available options makes them equally suitable for difficult rescue operations, when, for example, wreckage must be disassembled and disposed of. \n", "production": {}, "name": "Maintenance & Engineering Craft", "definition": "Maintenance & Utility"}
