It is essentially a combat variant of the freighter line with its cargo area is almost entirely replaced by an armoured fighting compartment with a mixture of different sized turrets and ordnance storage. Whilst in no way considered as a warship capable of taking on a military destroyer or even a large group of fighters all at once, it can pack a powerful defence against small raider groups. It is suitable as a convoy escort or to guard an important transport ship. A cunning captain might even rely on its similarity to a Styrvok freighter to lure a moderate raider into a close attack of what appears to be a helpless target - and then show it the sharp teeth of the trap it has unwittingly entered.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 360, "bio-optic wiring": 176, "scanning array": 92, "plasma-flow regulators": 32, "fusion reactors": 26, "reinforced metal plating": 90, "podkletnov generators": 38, "energy cells": 620, "microchips": 166}, "name": "Stromvok", "definition": "Transporter"}
