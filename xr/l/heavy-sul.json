While manoeuvrability may not be essential for a carrier, good acceleration certainly is. Regrettably, the Heavy Sul does not deliver in this regard either; sometimes, it is thus mockingly called Lazy Sul by friendly and enemy combatants alike. The PMC military advisory board actively prosecutes occurrences of this sort of slander, as it is perceived as eroding crew morale.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 440, "bio-optic wiring": 234, "scanning array": 132, "plasma-flow regulators": 42, "fusion reactors": 40, "reinforced metal plating": 128, "podkletnov generators": 56, "energy cells": 780, "microchips": 248}, "name": "Heavy Sul", "definition": "Carrier"}
