Mechano-taxonometrists are fairly certain that the line of TF/Xenon present in the known sectors today belong to the ninth diversification branch (of roughly 27). The K/BRANCH9 - commonly referred to as just K - is a large destroyer with decent manoeuvrability and an above average weapons system.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 670, "bio-optic wiring": 274, "scanning array": 172, "plasma-flow regulators": 74, "fusion reactors": 56, "reinforced metal plating": 226, "podkletnov generators": 128, "energy cells": 1440, "microchips": 272}, "name": "Xenon K", "definition": "Large destroyer"}
