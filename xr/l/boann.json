It is a hydrogen mining vessel that has seen many revisions since its initial introduction; its basic parameters, however, remain unchanged. Although capable of launching mining drones, the thrust-to-payload ratio of the Boann is low, and so is its manoeuvrability. Its weapon systems are not intended for tactical use - as can be expected from a commercial mining vessel.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 210, "bio-optic wiring": 62, "scanning array": 36, "plasma-flow regulators": 16, "fusion reactors": 14, "reinforced metal plating": 34, "podkletnov generators": 20, "energy cells": 370, "microchips": 68}, "name": "Boann", "definition": "Miner"}
