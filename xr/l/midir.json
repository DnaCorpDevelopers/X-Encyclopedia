It is a ions & plasma mining vessel that has seen many revisions since its initial introduction; its basic parameters, however, remain unchanged. Although capable of launching mining drones, the thrust-to-payload ratio of the Midir is very low, and so is its manoeuvrability. Its weapon systems are not intended for tactical use - as can be expected from a commercial mining vessel.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 190, "bio-optic wiring": 66, "scanning array": 34, "plasma-flow regulators": 10, "fusion reactors": 12, "reinforced metal plating": 36, "podkletnov generators": 22, "energy cells": 360, "microchips": 60}, "name": "Midir", "definition": "Miner"}
