Based on a Common Ground design just like its siblings, this large vessel has only basic weapons and is neither agile nor capable of fast acceleration. Its intended (and only) use is the transport of goods in a liquid state of aggregation. It is easily recognisable by its distinctive storage modules.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 230, "bio-optic wiring": 88, "scanning array": 38, "plasma-flow regulators": 14, "fusion reactors": 16, "reinforced metal plating": 46, "podkletnov generators": 22, "energy cells": 420, "microchips": 92}, "name": "Rahanas Liquid", "definition": "Transporter"}
