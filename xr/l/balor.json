It is small and agile due to its responsive and powerful main engine and attitude thrusters. Although its weapons systems are regarded as average compared to other frigates, they are still quite formidable for a ship that small. The Balor has an elaborate ejection mechanism that can deliver torpedoes to within a meters range of the projected target area from as far as a half light-second away. The vessel is capable of performing complex missions on its own, specialising in the delivery of torpedoes.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 290, "bio-optic wiring": 124, "scanning array": 58, "plasma-flow regulators": 22, "fusion reactors": 18, "reinforced metal plating": 58, "podkletnov generators": 26, "energy cells": 480, "microchips": 118}, "name": "Balor", "definition": "Frigate"}
