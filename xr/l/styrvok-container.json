Based on a relatively elderly and long-unaltered design, these ships often appear as beaten-up, well-patched work-horses that have seen much better days. They can still be built, for the right buyer, at a Canteran shipyard but the shiny newly-produced ones really stand out compared to the older much-used versions. Such new ones share the same specifications with the older models and so are not at all cutting-edge. Compared to other more modern freighter designs they are much smaller with less freight capacity, although that sometimes gives them an edge on pick-up and delivery speed. The roles of the single-ware and mixed-ware type models can be identified from the individually-distinctive cargo area designs.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 260, "bio-optic wiring": 40, "scanning array": 22, "plasma-flow regulators": 8, "fusion reactors": 10, "reinforced metal plating": 24, "podkletnov generators": 8, "energy cells": 450, "microchips": 42}, "name": "Styrvok Container", "definition": "Transporter"}
