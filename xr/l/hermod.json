According to its construction design, its sole purpose is the transport of goods in their liquid state of aggregation. It is poor in both acceleration and deceleration and its manoeuvrability is equally poor. It has just a token weapon of no tactical value. Its only real means of defence, therefore, is the unimportance of the Republic of Cantera.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 160, "bio-optic wiring": 18, "scanning array": 28, "plasma-flow regulators": 10, "fusion reactors": 14, "reinforced metal plating": 28, "podkletnov generators": 12, "energy cells": 310, "microchips": 66}, "name": "Hermod", "definition": "Transporter"}
