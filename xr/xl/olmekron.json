It is commonly employed by the Argon government and Jonferson Space Systems for escort and peacekeeping duties. Its relatively large size for a destroyer means some loss of speed and acceleration in comparison with other destroyers, but it is certainly on a par with them in terms of firepower as its weapon systems are quite technologically advanced in comparison. If it has a weakness, it is that its angular hull design offers less room for drone storage than many other destroyers.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 760, "bio-optic wiring": 316, "scanning array": 226, "plasma-flow regulators": 112, "fusion reactors": 82, "reinforced metal plating": 286, "podkletnov generators": 162, "energy cells": 1620, "microchips": 352}, "name": "Olmekron", "definition": "Large destroyer"}
