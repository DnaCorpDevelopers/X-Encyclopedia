It keeps the angular Y shape of its sister ship but is even bigger and more formidable-looking; it is the largest non-Xenon destroyer known to be in production. It is employed, albeit rarely, by the Argon government and by Jonferson Space Systems as a prestige escort, as an ultimate defence and for punitive attack duties. Its size hinders its acceleration, speed and manoeuvrability, but its greater bulk allows it to house even more technologically advanced weapon systems than the Olmekron. If it has a weakness outside of its speed and agility, it is that, like its sister the Olmekron, its angular hull design and many fixed weapons systems leave surprisingly little residual space for drone storage.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 960, "bio-optic wiring": 648, "scanning array": 358, "plasma-flow regulators": 168, "fusion reactors": 104, "reinforced metal plating": 444, "podkletnov generators": 336, "energy cells": 1980, "microchips": 536}, "name": "Fulmekron", "definition": "Large destroyer"}
