Even though regarded as slightly clumsy by some with respect to manoeuvrability, this classic destroyer is a heavy-hitter - flies like a brick, kills like a blade is a common saying among combat pilots that have flown the Taranis. Although mainly used for sector patrol along highly disputed borders or other such areas, this ship is no stranger to battle. It has great tactical value and has been copied by other manufacturers.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 710, "bio-optic wiring": 332, "scanning array": 198, "plasma-flow regulators": 92, "fusion reactors": 64, "reinforced metal plating": 258, "podkletnov generators": 152, "energy cells": 1580, "microchips": 314}, "name": "Taranis", "definition": "Destroyer"}
