One of the better maintained relics of the Terran era, this ship usually patrols close to stations to keep up a strong visual presence to both the Canterans and Reivers. The Sucellus acceleration is average, and its agility is severely hindered by its sub-par attitude thrusters. Despite all of this, pilots who have flown this ship for some time usually come to love it for its reliability.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 640, "bio-optic wiring": 254, "scanning array": 148, "plasma-flow regulators": 62, "fusion reactors": 46, "reinforced metal plating": 186, "podkletnov generators": 114, "energy cells": 1320, "microchips": 238}, "name": "Sucellus", "definition": "Armored patrol"}
