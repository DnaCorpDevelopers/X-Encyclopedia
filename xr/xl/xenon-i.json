Mechano-taxonometrists are fairly certain that the line of TF/Xenon present in the known sectors today belong to the ninth diversification branch (of roughly 27). The I/BRANCH9 - commonly referred to as just I - is probably the largest warship in the known galaxy. So far, it has only been spotted from great distances as nobody has lived through any closer encounter with it. It is therefore anticipated to be a most fearsome machine that, even if alone, has little to fear from other single capital ships or even modest fleets. Nothing more is really known about it yet rumour about it and paranoid false-sighting reports are rife. So far, and most fortunately, it has not been reliably reported to be seen venturing outside of Xenon core sectors. Indeed, it is not known if more than one of these behemoth war machines actually exists.\n\n", "production": {}, "name": "Xenon I", "definition": "Warship"}
