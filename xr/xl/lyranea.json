Bigger than the equivalent Albion Rahanas in terms of size and cargo-space, it is somewhat slower. It is armed for self-defence purposes with more and larger weapons turrets than its Albion equivalent. Currently configured to be able to carry all classes of wares in multipurpose storage, the Lyranea design could most probably be easily converted for more efficient carriage of single or dual classes of wares - if the commercial demand were to be there.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 280, "bio-optic wiring": 128, "scanning array": 56, "plasma-flow regulators": 22, "fusion reactors": 30, "reinforced metal plating": 88, "podkletnov generators": 38, "energy cells": 620, "microchips": 148}, "name": "Lyranea", "definition": "Transporter"}
