Generally what can be said about its larger sibling is also true with regard to the Moebius. Its manoeuvrability and thrust-to-payload ratio are each one of a kind, leading this class of ship, and its handsome weapon array outshines similar ships with ease. It is, however, not clear how PMC - a company better known for crude mining operations than the design of elegant and powerful warships - was able to acquire the Moebius design plans. One thing is clear to experts: PMC could not have it done it all by themselves.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 47, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 3, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 3, "reinforced metal plating": 6, "podkletnov generators": 4, "energy cells": 137, "microchips": 3}, "name": "Moebius", "definition": "Fighter"}
