However, it features sophisticated torpedo launchers and, for all intents and purposes, constitutes a bomber. It is mainly used against ground installations but can as well attack and swiftly destroy large orbital complexes.\nDuring the Fourth Xenon Uprising (which later came to be known as the IRQ4 conflict), several Drostan class bombers laid waste to two off-ecliptic Xenon power stations. All of the Drostan returned, with not a single casualty. The Drostan is an important tactical asset.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 338, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 23, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 11, "reinforced metal plating": 52, "podkletnov generators": 1, "energy cells": 979, "microchips": 23}, "name": "Drostan ", "definition": "Tactical bomber"}
