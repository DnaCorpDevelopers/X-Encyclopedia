Since chemical and/or nuclear energy cells can pose dangers to populations and ecosystems, this type of heavy freighter must be licensed for the transportation of hazardous materials; it also has to undergo regular technical inspection to keep the licence. Piloting this type of ship needs a special licence on the part of the pilot. The Gigurum Energy Transporter is neither fast nor agile, and is completely unarmed.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 46, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 2, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 2, "reinforced metal plating": 6, "podkletnov generators": 2, "energy cells": 134, "microchips": 3}, "name": "Gigurum Energy", "definition": "Transporter"}
