With its line of freighters, Gigurum have brought the concept of bulk ware to its logical extremes. At first, there was plenty of resistance against the very restricted formats of goods that could be transported. Over time, however, the concept proved extremely efficient and became the preferred method of transportation for all kinds of bulk goods across the sectors. The Gigurum Bulk Transporter is not fast, and not at all agile, and is completely unarmed. It has, however, become indispensible in todays world of effective and cheap bulk good transportation.\n\n", "production": {"food rations": 43, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 2, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 2, "reinforced metal plating": 5, "podkletnov generators": 2, "energy cells": 125, "microchips": 3}, "name": "Gigurum Bulk", "definition": "Transporter"}
