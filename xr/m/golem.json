Built upon advanced technology obviously gleaned from as-yet unknown sources, it is speculated, and widely accepted, that this ship must have been a co-development between PMC and Beryll Astrotech. Featuring an impressive thrust-to-payload ratio for a vessel of this size, its manoeuvrability is equally astonishing considering the sheer mass involved. Just as notable is the handsome array of weapons; it can pick a fight anytime without hesitation. All round, the Golem does not repeat the design flaws seen in other PMC productions but is instead one of the finest ships bribery can obtain. \n", "production": {"food rations": 119, "bio-optic wiring": 0, "scanning array": 8, "plasma-flow regulators": 0, "fusion reactors": 2, "reinforced metal plating": 15, "podkletnov generators": 9, "energy cells": 345, "microchips": 8}, "name": "Golem", "definition": "Fighter"}
